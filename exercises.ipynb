    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few issues with the *loader.py* file. Use the VS Code debugger to find the issues, and adjust for them appropriately (e.g., using try-except, renaming variables, rewriting code, etc.). As always, make sure your code aligns with PEP-8 as much as you can.\n",

    "- **Raised Exceptions**:\n",
    "    - This will cause the debugger to stop when an exception is raised *before* the next line, *even if* you handle it with an `except` clause.\n",
    "- **Uncaught Exceptions**:\n",
    "    - This will only cause the debugger to stop if an exception (error) is not handled with an `except` clause. (So, in other words, the debugger \"checks\" for one first.)\n",
    "- **User Uncaught Exceptions**:\n",
    "    - This is regarding errors that exist *within* imported packages.\n",
    "- **\\[filename.py\\]**:\n",
    "    - When you add breakpoints to a file, it will be indicated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend only selecting *\"Uncaught Exceptions\"* (and adding in your own breakpoints). This way, you can focus only on errors that are being missed. Also, make sure to take advantage of the Debugger Console in the terminal section of VS Code! It is a nice way to interact with your code as it's being run.\n",
